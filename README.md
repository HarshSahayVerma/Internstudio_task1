Predictive Customer Churn Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project develops a predictive model to analyze customer churn for a subscription-based service (e.g., telecom, streaming platforms). It leverages machine learning algorithms to identify customers at risk of leaving based on various behavioral patterns and account activity.

📊 Data Used

The analysis is based on historical customer data, including:

Demographics (age, gender, location)

Usage patterns (subscription duration, frequency of usage, etc.)

Customer interactions (support tickets, complaints, feedback scores)
